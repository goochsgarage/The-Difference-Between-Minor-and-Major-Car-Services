The Difference Between Minor and Major Car Services
Regular car maintenance is essential for ensuring safety, performance, and longevity. Yet, many drivers wonder what separates a minor service from a major one. Understanding the difference is crucial for making informed decisions about your vehicle’s upkeep.
What Is a Minor Car Service?
A minor car service is a routine check-up focused on essential maintenance tasks and quick inspections. It typically occurs every 10,000 to 15,000km or at least once a year, depending on your manufacturer’s guidelines. The goal is early detection of problems and keeping your car running smoothly between major overhauls.
Common Tasks in a Minor Service
•	Engine oil and oil filter change
•	Checking and topping up fluids (brake, coolant, power steering, washer)
•	Inspecting and inflating tyres
•	Checking battery health
•	Inspecting brakes and clutch assembly
•	Checking air and cabin filters (cleaning or replacing if necessary)
•	Visual inspection of belts, hoses, and exhaust
•	Assessing lights, windscreen wipers, and washer systems
•	Wheel alignment and basic suspension inspection
•	Quick diagnostic scan (in some workshops)[1][2][3][4][5]
Why Minor Servicing Matters
Minor services prevent small issues from escalating into major, costly repairs. They also help maintain warranty compliance and keep your vehicle safe and efficient on the road[4].
What Is a Major Car Service?
A major car service is an in-depth, comprehensive maintenance procedure, performed less frequently—usually every 30,000 to 45,000km or every two to three years, depending on your car’s age and type. This service covers everything a minor service offers, plus extensive checks and part replacements[4][5][6].
Key Additions in a Major Service
•	All minor service tasks
•	Replacement of spark plugs
•	Fuel filter and air filter replacement
•	Brake fluid replacement (full system flush)
•	Detailed inspection of the engine, transmission, suspension, and ignition systems
•	Replacement or service of drive belts, timing belts (as needed)
•	Full brake system inspection (including pads and discs)
•	Comprehensive check of electrical systems
•	Detailed inspection for leaks, wear, and corrosion across all systems
•	Full road test and diagnostics[4][5][6][7]
Why Major Servicing Matters
Major services address deeper issues, replace worn components, and update consumables that naturally degrade with time and distance. Regular major servicing is critical for car safety, optimal fuel efficiency, and retaining your vehicle’s market value over time[4][6].
Minor vs. Major Service at a Glance
	Minor Service	Major Service
Frequency	10,000–15,000km or yearly	30,000–45,000km or every 2–3 years
Focus	Quick checks and top-ups	Comprehensive replacements and checks
Typical Duration	1–2 hours	Several hours
Typical Cost	Lower	Higher
Main Tasks	Oil/filter change, basics	Spark plugs, fluid flush, full inspection, major parts replacement

Conclusion
Both minor and major car services serve unique and important roles in car care. Skipping either can lead to expensive repairs or unsafe driving conditions. Always refer to your vehicle’s owner manual and stick to the recommended servicing schedule to protect your investment and keep your journey smooth[1][4][5][6].
